🏡 Real Estate EDA Project
Completed as part of Vyoma Trainings – Data Analytics Program
📌 Project Overview

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Real Estate dataset to understand property price trends, location-based variations, correlations, and factors that influence market value.
The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw data using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess the dataset

Handle missing or inconsistent data

Understand price distribution across locations

Visualize property size, price, and feature relationships

Identify patterns and insights for real estate decision-making

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Explorations

Price vs. Location analysis

Property size distribution

Outlier detection and removal

Correlation heatmaps

Trend visualization using various charts

Identification of high-value zones

Feature-wise impact on price

📈 Insights & Outcomes

Clear understanding of market trends and pricing behaviors

Identified top performing locations in terms of price

Discovered factors that significantly affect property value

Improved data analysis, visualization, and storytelling skills

Strong foundation for future Machine Learning models (Price Prediction)
